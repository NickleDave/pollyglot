# vocal-annotation-formats
Small example datasets for different formats of annotating vocalizations.

The [Makefile](./Makefile) creates an archive from each subdirectory 
in [data](./data). These are then uploaded to Figshare.

The reason for creating this repository is not to use GitHub as a data 
store. The goal is to share code that automates the process of creating a data 
repository on FigShare, and make this source open for collaboration. The 
formats in this repository can be parsed by the 
[Crowsetta](<https://github.com/NickleDave/crowsetta>) package. Development and 
tutorials for `crowsetta` make use of the small, quick-to-download archives of 
each format on Figshare that are generated from the source in this repository.

`crowsetta` provides tools for anyone that wants to write clean code 
when working with these annotion formats (or their own format)
